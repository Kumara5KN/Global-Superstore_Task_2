📄 Simple Project README: Global Superstore Sales Analysis🎯 Project GoalTo conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Sales Performance Analysis on the Global Superstore dataset to identify key trends and build a preliminary predictive sales model.💾 Datasetglobal_superstore.csvKey Columns: Sales, Profit, Discount, Region, Category, Date.📊 Key Findings1. Profitability & RiskCritical Correlation: There is a strong negative correlation ($-0.57$) between Discount and Profit. High discounts are the primary cause of transactions resulting in losses.Anomaly: High sales often correlate with high shipping costs, suggesting larger, higher-value orders are expensive to fulfill.2. Performance & TrendsSeasonality: Sales show consistent yearly seasonality, with revenue peaking sharply in the Fourth Quarter (Q4).Top Performers: The highest total sales come from the Central Region and the Technology Category.3. Predictive ModelModel: Linear Regression ($\text{Sales} \sim \text{Profit} + \text{Discount}$).Evaluation: The model was weak ($\mathbf{R^2} = 0.2708$), indicating that Profit and Discount alone are insufficient predictors for Sales volume.✅ Actionable RecommendationOptimize Discounting Strategy: Implement a strict discount ceiling (e.g., $\approx 20\%$) to prevent transactions from falling into negative profit margins. Use high discounts only for strategic inventory clearance.⚙️ Tools & LibrariesPython, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn.
